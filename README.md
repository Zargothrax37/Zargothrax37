- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jonathan
- ðŸŒ± This year i decided it is time for some change and picked up Python, the last 6 months have been challenging but i am exited about the progress i have made in that time. I still have a long way to go but have learned that i enjoy writing code and am very positive about what the future brings!
