- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m trying to get familiar with the coding world

<!---
This year i decided it is time for some change and picked up Python, the last 6 months have been challenging but i am exited about the progress i have made in that time. I still have a long way to go but have learned that i enjoy writing code and am very positive about what the future brings!
